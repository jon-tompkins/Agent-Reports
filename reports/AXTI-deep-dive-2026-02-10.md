# AXTI (AXT Inc) Deep Dive
**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Thesis:** Low-cap InP manufacturer riding AI data center wave, with significant China export control risk

---

## Company Overview
AXT Inc is a materials-science company manufacturing compound semiconductor substrate wafers:
- **Indium Phosphide (InP)** — data-center optics, 5G, fiber-optic lasers, detectors
- **Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)** — RF amplifiers, Wi-Fi, satellite communications, VCSELs
- **Germanium (Ge)** — solar cells, infrared detectors

**Key differentiator:** Proprietary vertical-gradient freeze (VGF) crystal-growth process produces high-purity, low-defect InP substrates — superior to commodity-grade alternatives.

**Critical Note:** Manufacturing is in CHINA, making them subject to Chinese export controls.

## Recent Financials

### Q3 2025 Results (Latest)
| Metric | Q3 2025 | Q2 2025 | Q3 2024 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Revenue | $28.0M | $18.0M | $23.6M |
| InP Revenue | $13.1M | $3.6M | $6.8M |
| Gross Margin (non-GAAP) | 22.4% | 8.2% | 24.3% |
| Net Loss | ($1.17M) | ($6.4M) | ($2.12M) |
| EPS | ($0.03) | ($0.15) | ($0.05) |

**Key highlights:**
- InP revenue grew **250% sequentially** (was expected to grow 30%)
- Revenue beat guidance of $19-21M by wide margin
- InP backlog: **$49M+ and growing** (record high, doubled from Q2)

### TTM Revenue: ~$90.4M (down 4.5% YoY due to mid-year export delays)

### Balance Sheet
- Cash & investments: $31.2M (down from $35.1M)
- Net cash position (no net debt)
- Net debt/EBITDA: -2.0x (healthy)
- Inventory: $77.7M (being reduced)

## Dilution Risk ⚠️

### December 2025 Public Offering: $87 MILLION
- This is significant dilution for a ~$700M market cap company
- Share count has increased materially
- May need additional raises if losses continue

**Current valuation:** 3.3x EV/Sales (vs 5-yr avg 2.6x, market median 4.5x)

## Export Control Risk (THE BIG ONE) 🚨

### Timeline:
- **August 2023:** China imposed export controls on GaAs
- **February 2025:** China added InP to export control list
- **Current:** Every customer order requires government export permit

### Impact:
- Permits taking ~60 business days (~3 months) to process
- Customers adapting with longer lead-times and advance ordering
- Creates revenue recognition volatility
- **Q1 2026 risk:** US-China policy updates could materially impact permit processes

### Mitigants:
- Company has been successful obtaining permits so far
- Growing backlog suggests customers committed despite delays
- Customers placing longer-term orders for visibility

## Growth Catalysts

1. **AI Data Center Buildout**
   - Massive CapEx from hyperscalers (Google, MSFT, AWS)
   - InP-based lasers/detectors essential for high-speed optical connectivity
   - 800G/1.6T transceivers require InP substrates

2. **Silicon Photonics Adoption**
   - InP increasingly integrated into silicon photonics platforms
   - New tier-1 customer qualifications underway

3. **5G Infrastructure**
   - RF applications driving GaAs demand
   - Semi-insulating wafers for wireless devices

4. **Q4 2025 Guidance:** $27-30M revenue (continued momentum)

## Key Risks

| Risk | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| China export controls | HIGH | Single biggest risk - all manufacturing in China |
| Geopolitical escalation | HIGH | US-China tensions could disrupt entirely |
| Profitability | MEDIUM | Still losing money, negative ROIC (-7.8%) |
| Dilution | MEDIUM | $87M raise in Dec 2025, may need more |
| Volatility | HIGH | Beta 2.56, 132% annualized volatility |
| Customer concentration | MEDIUM | Top 5 customers = 45% of revenue |
| Competition | MEDIUM | Sumitomo, Coherent (II-VI), IQE |

## Valuation

- **EV/Sales:** 3.3x (at historical norms, below 4.5x market median)
- **P/E:** N/A (unprofitable)
- **Market Cap:** ~$700M
- **Price Target (analysts):** $7.70 (implies 68% downside from current levels!)

**Note:** Stock has run 155% over past 12 months — priced for perfection.

---

## Summary

**Bull Case:**
- Secular tailwind from AI/data center buildout
- Record backlog ($49M+ InP) provides visibility
- Technology moat with VGF process
- Net cash balance sheet
- Return to profitability expected in 2026

**Bear Case:**
- All eggs in China basket — export controls are existential risk
- Stock up 155% YTD, analysts see 68% downside
- Still unprofitable with continued cash burn
- Significant dilution from $87M raise
- Extreme volatility (beta 2.56)

**Bottom Line:** High-risk, high-reward play on AI infrastructure. The InP demand story is real, but the China export control risk is substantial. Position sizing should reflect the binary nature of the geopolitical risk.
