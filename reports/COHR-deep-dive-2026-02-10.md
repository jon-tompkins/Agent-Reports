# COHR (Coherent Corp) Deep Dive
**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Thesis:** US-based photonics leader, nearshoring beneficiary, AI data center infrastructure play

---

## Company Overview
Coherent Corp is a global leader in photonics, formed from the merger of II-VI and Coherent (2022). They provide:
- **Optical transceivers** (800G, 1.6T for AI data centers)
- **Silicon photonics** components
- **Indium Phosphide** substrates and lasers
- **Silicon Carbide (SiC)** for power electronics
- **Laser systems** for industrial/telecom applications

**Key differentiator:** Vertically integrated US-based manufacturing, CHIPS Act beneficiary, diversified across multiple photonics markets.

| Q4 FY25 Revenue | ~$1.5B | - | - |

### Q1 FY2026 (Sept 2025)
| Metric | Q1 FY26 | Q1 FY25 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Revenue | $1.58B | $1.35B | +17% YoY |
| Sequential Growth | +3% | - | - |

### Key Segment: Networking (AI/Datacom)
- Primary growth driver
- First revenue from **1.6T datacom transceivers**
- Optical circuit switch platform for AI datacenters
- Silicon photonics 800G/1.6T modules ramping

### Guidance Q1 FY26:
- Revenue: $1.46-1.60B
- Non-GAAP EPS: $0.93-1.13

## Nearshoring / CHIPS Act Angle 🇺🇸

### US Manufacturing Footprint:
- **Texas facility expansion:** $33M investment (late 2024)
- Aligned with CHIPS and Science Act incentives
- Domestic production capability for sensitive photonics

### Competitive Advantage:
- Unlike AXTI (China-based), Coherent has significant US manufacturing
- Less exposed to China export control risks
- Potential to capture share from China-dependent competitors
- Government/defense contracts more accessible

## Product Portfolio

### AI/Data Center Products:
1. **1.6T Datacom Transceivers** — first revenue in FY25
2. **800G Pluggables** — high-volume production
3. **Optical Circuit Switches** — AI datacenter architecture
4. **Silicon Photonics ICs** — Mach-Zehnder drivers for 800G/1.6T

### Recent Innovations:
- **300mm Silicon Carbide (SiC) platform** — addressing thermal efficiency demands in AI datacenters
- Silicon photonics modules with 500m reach, reduced power consumption
- Quad-channel ICs for 400G ZR/ZR+ links

---

## Growth Catalysts

1. **AI Infrastructure Buildout**
   - Hyperscaler CapEx accelerating
   - Coherent positioned across the optical stack
   - 1.6T transition starting (first revenues in hand)

2. **Silicon Photonics Leadership**
   - Integrated solutions for data centers
   - Lower power consumption = key differentiator
   - Multiple product generations in market

3. **SiC for Power/Thermal**
   - 300mm platform for AI datacenter power management
   - Growing TAM as AI power demands explode

4. **Nearshoring Tailwinds**
   - CHIPS Act benefits
   - Customer preference for non-China supply chains
   - Defense/government opportunities

## Financial Health

### Strengths:
- Profitable and generating cash
- Diversified revenue streams
- Strong balance sheet post-merger integration

### Concerns:
- One-off loss of $150.9M impacting recent 12-month results
- Integration costs from II-VI merger
- Acquisition-related debt (manageable but present)

### Valuation:
- **Market Cap:** ~$15B+
- Trading at reasonable multiples vs growth
- Premium to pure-play substrate makers justified by vertical integration

---

## Key Risks

| Risk | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Integration execution | MEDIUM | II-VI merger still being digested |
| Cyclicality | MEDIUM | Semiconductor/telecom cycles |
| Competition | MEDIUM | Intel, Broadcom, Lumentum in silicon photonics |
| Customer concentration | LOW-MED | Hyperscaler dependence |
| Debt from acquisitions | LOW-MED | Manageable but present |
| China exposure | LOW | Much less than AXTI |

---

## Competitive Position

### vs AXTI:
- Much larger ($15B+ vs $700M market cap)
- US manufacturing base (lower geopolitical risk)
- Vertically integrated (substrates → modules)
- More diversified revenue

### vs POET:
- Proven at scale (vs POET's pre-revenue)
- Incumbent relationships
- But less "moonshot" upside

### Competitors:
- Intel (silicon photonics)
- Broadcom (transceivers)
- Lumentum (lasers)
- II-VI (now part of Coherent)

---

## Summary

**Bull Case:**
- AI data center buildout is a multi-year supercycle
- Best-positioned US photonics company
- Diversified across substrates, transceivers, SiC
- CHIPS Act tailwind
- 1.6T product cycle just beginning
- Already profitable with scale

**Bear Case:**
- Not a "small cap moonshot" — upside may be more modest
- Integration complexity from mega-merger
- Competition from well-funded peers
- Cyclical industry
- Some China revenue exposure (less than peers)

**Bottom Line:** COHR is the "quality" play in this space. Lower risk than AXTI (no China manufacturing dependency), proven profitability, positioned for AI infrastructure buildout. The nearshoring thesis is solid. Less upside than AXTI/POET moonshots, but much better risk-adjusted.
