## Investment Thesis

### Bull Case 🐂

1. **Profitable Cash Machine** — $3B FCF (TTM), ~21% FCF margin
2. **Cheap Valuation** — 13x forward P/E, 0.6 PEG ratio
3. **Margin Expansion** — Operating margins up from 10% (2022) to 14% (2025)
4. **Share Buybacks** — Aggressively retiring shares (-8% YoY)
5. **AI Adaptation** — Partnering with ChatGPT rather than fighting it
6. **Travel Demand Resilient** — Post-pandemic normalization continues

### Bear Case 🐻

1. **AI Disruption Risk** — Google, ChatGPT could disintermediate OTAs
2. **High Debt Load** — $6.5B debt, 4.85x Debt/Equity
3. **Google Dependency** — Significant ad spend on Google search
4. **Competition** — Booking.com dominates internationally; Airbnb in alternatives
5. **Negative Working Capital** — Current ratio 0.74
6. **Macro Sensitivity** — Recession would hurt discretionary travel

## The AI Disruption Question

### The Threat
Per HBR (Jan 2026): *"Gen AI Is Threatening the Platforms That Dominate Online Travel"*

The risk is **disintermediation**:
- AI assistants (ChatGPT, Google Gemini) could become the new booking interface
- Users ask AI to "book me a flight to Paris" rather than visiting Expedia
- Airlines/hotels could go direct via AI partnerships
- Google's agentic AI could execute bookings end-to-end

### Expedia's Response
**Adaptation over resistance:**
- Partnered with OpenAI — Expedia is inside ChatGPT
- Building own AI tools (travel assistant, recommendations)
- Positioning as the backend "fulfillment layer" for AI agents
- Vrbo/vacation rentals less vulnerable to AI booking

**Strategic Insight:** Expedia isn't fighting ChatGPT — they're becoming its travel API. This is smart. If AI agents become the new interface, Expedia wants to be the execution layer, not the disrupted middleman.

## Risk Factors

### High Risk ⚠️
1. **AI Disintermediation** — ChatGPT/Google could bypass OTAs
2. **Google Traffic Dependency** — Rising CAC if Google prioritizes own products
3. **Recession** — Discretionary travel first to get cut

### Medium Risk
4. **Competition** — Booking, Airbnb, direct hotel bookings
5. **Debt Load** — $6.5B debt constrains flexibility
6. **Regulatory** — EU DMA could affect data practices

### Low Risk
7. **Currency** — International exposure creates FX volatility
8. **Vrbo Execution** — Turnaround still in progress

---

## Investment Summary

### The Good ✅
1. **Cheap valuation** — 13x forward P/E, 10% FCF yield
2. **Cash generation** — $3B FCF, 21% FCF margin
3. **Margin expansion** — Operating leverage improving
4. **AI adaptation** — Partnering with ChatGPT, not fighting it
5. **Buybacks** — Share count declining 8%/year

### The Concerns ⚠️
1. **AI disruption** — Real existential question for OTA model
2. **Google risk** — What if Google goes direct?
3. **Debt** — $6.5B limits strategic flexibility
4. **Growth slowing** — 7% revenue growth vs 30%+ at Airbnb

### The Verdict

**Value play with AI optionality risk.** 

Expedia is a profitable, cash-generating business trading at a significant discount to peers. The market is pricing in AI disruption fear. If Expedia successfully becomes the "backend for AI travel" (ChatGPT partnership), the stock re-rates higher. If AI disintermediates OTAs, the thesis breaks.

**Asymmetric Setup:**
- Bull case: AI partner strategy works, stock re-rates to 18-20x = $300-350
- Base case: Business continues, 13x forward P/E = $240-250 (current)
- Bear case: AI disruption accelerates = $150-180

**Catalyst:** Q4 earnings Feb 12. Watch for AI strategy commentary.

---

## Bottom Line

EXPE is a **contrarian value buy** for investors who believe:
1. OTAs won't be fully disintermediated by AI
2. Expedia's "backend partner" strategy can work
3. Travel demand remains resilient

At 13x forward earnings and 10% FCF yield, a lot of pessimism is priced in. The question is whether that pessimism is justified.

**Risk/Reward:** Attractive for value investors comfortable with AI disruption risk.
