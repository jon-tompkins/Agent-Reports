## Investment Thesis

### Bull Case
- **Fintech SuperApp Evolution:** Successfully pivoted from meme-stock app to diversified platform with Gold Card, prediction markets, retirement accounts, and international expansion
- **Record Profitability:** FY2025 revenue $4.5B (+52% YoY), net income $1.9B — proving sustainable business model
- **Wealth Transfer Beneficiary:** Positioned to capture $84T generational wealth transfer with mobile-first, high-yield platform targeting Gen Z/Millennials
- **S&P 500 Inclusion:** Late 2025 inclusion brings institutional flows and index fund buying
- **Product Velocity:** More features launched in 2 years than first 8 years combined — Legend desktop, Gold Card, prediction markets, UK/EU expansion

### Bear Case
- **Crypto Dependency:** Transaction revenue still swings with BTC cycles; Q4 crypto revenue missed by $27M
- **Valuation Premium:** Trading at 36x P/E vs 15-20x for traditional brokers
- **CFO Transition:** Jason Warnick stepped down; Shiv Verma new CFO as of Feb 6
- **Revenue Miss Reaction:** Stock dropped 12% on Q4 miss despite strong full-year numbers — investors twitchy on growth deceleration
- **Aggressive Subsidies:** 3% IRA match expensive if retention doesn't hold

## Investment Summary / Bottom Line

### Rating Justification

Robinhood has successfully completed its transformation from a controversial meme-stock app to a legitimate, profitable fintech platform. The FY2025 numbers are undeniably impressive: $4.5B revenue (+52%), $1.9B net income, and AUC crossing $333B. The company is executing on multiple fronts — international expansion, product diversification, and high-net-worth customer acquisition.

The Q4 miss is a speed bump, not a structural problem. Crypto revenue volatility is real but manageable given the diversification into Gold subscriptions, net interest income, and prediction markets. The CFO transition adds uncertainty but Verma is an internal promotion with institutional knowledge.

At $74.14 with RSI at 27.84, the stock is technically oversold after a 34% YTD drawdown. Wall Street's mean price target of $113.74 implies 53% upside. While valuation remains rich (36x P/E), the growth rate justifies some premium. The risk/reward at these levels favors buyers with a 6-12 month horizon.

### Trade Suggestion

- **Entry:** $70 - $78 range (current levels or slight dip)
- **Stop Loss:** $58 (22% downside — below major support)
- **Target 1:** $95 (28% upside — 200 DMA reclaim)
- **Target 2:** $115 (55% upside — analyst consensus area)
- **Position Size:** Small to Medium (high beta = position sizing matters)
- **Time Horizon:** 6-12 months

**Alternative:** For lower risk, wait for $70 support test or 50 DMA reclaim above $111
