---

## Investment Thesis

### Bull Case
- **Strategic US Asset:** Only large-scale domestic lithium source; bipartisan government support (Trump & Biden administrations both backed it)
- **DOE Loan Secured:** $2.26B government-backed loan significantly de-risks financing
- **GM Partnership:** General Motors invested $650M for 38% stake in JV; offtake agreement in place
- **Construction Progressing:** Bechtel as EPC contractor; peak construction in 2026, production expected 2027
- **Lithium Cycle Turning:** Market bottomed in 2025; supply cuts industrywide setting up for tighter market

### Bear Case
- **Pre-Revenue Cash Burn:** -$647M FCF (TTM); dependent on construction timeline
- **Lithium Price Uncertainty:** Prices at 4-year lows; may stay depressed if EV demand disappoints
- **Execution Risk:** First-of-kind clay lithium extraction at commercial scale; technology risk
- **Dilution History:** Shares nearly doubled via public offerings; more possible
- **Policy Volatility:** Trump admin walked back critical mineral price floor promises in Jan 2026

## Valuation

### Current Multiples

| Multiple | LAC | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| P/E (TTM) | N/A | Negative earnings |
| P/E (Fwd) | N/A | -$0.32 EPS expected |
| P/Sales | N/A | Pre-revenue |
| P/B | 2.47 | Trading at ~2.5x book |

### Peer Comparison

| Company | Ticker | Market Cap | Stage | Notes |
|---------|--------|------------|-------|-------|
| **Lithium Americas** | LAC | $1.2B | Pre-production | Thacker Pass 2027 |
| Albemarle | ALB | $20.4B | Producing | Largest US lithium producer |
| SQM | SQM | $10.3B | Producing | Chilean brine |
| Piedmont Lithium | PLL | $0.4B | Development | North Carolina project |
| Sigma Lithium | SGML | $1.4B | Producing | Brazil hard rock |

**Valuation Note:** LAC trades at a premium to book due to strategic value of Thacker Pass + DOE backing. Fair value highly dependent on lithium price assumptions and execution.

## Competitive Position

### Moat / Advantages
- **Largest US deposit:** 3.1M tonnes LCE measured + indicated
- **Government backing:** DOE loan, bipartisan support for domestic critical minerals
- **GM partnership:** Strategic offtake + capital
- **Permitting complete:** ROD received 2021; construction underway

### Key Competitors
- ALB (producing, diversified)
- SQM (low-cost Chilean brine)
- Australian hard rock producers (Pilbara, IGO)
- Chinese refiners (dominant in processing)

### Threats
- Lithium oversupply if EV adoption slows
- Technology disruption (sodium-ion batteries)
- Cheaper South American brine projects

## Recent Developments / Catalysts

### Recent News
- **Feb 2026:** Stock volatile on rare earth policy headlines (ricochet from Trump walking back price floor commitments)
- **Dec 2025:** Added to S&P/TSX Composite Index
- **Nov 2025:** Q3 2025 results — construction on track, DOE loan fully secured
- **Oct 2025:** Stock ran 100%+ on critical minerals optimism before pulling back

### Upcoming Catalysts
- **2026:** Peak construction activity; major equipment deliveries
- **2027:** Phase 1 production start (target)

## Investment Summary / Bottom Line

### Rating Justification

LAC is a **high-risk, high-reward** play on domestic US lithium production. The bull case is compelling: Thacker Pass is a world-class asset with government backing (DOE loan), a strategic partner (GM), and a competent EPC contractor (Bechtel). If construction stays on track and lithium prices recover, this stock could re-rate significantly.

However, the bear case is real: LAC is pre-revenue, burning cash, and dependent on lithium prices that have been crushed. The stock already ran 100%+ in late 2025 and has given back half those gains. Analyst sentiment has turned cautious (multiple downgrades to Hold).

**For Jon's portfolio:** You already have exposure via 400 shares + LEAPS ($10C Jan 2027). The position is underwater but the thesis is intact IF you believe:
1. Thacker Pass achieves production in 2027
2. Lithium prices stabilize or recover
3. No further significant dilution

Current position sizing looks appropriate for a speculative/thematic bet. Adding more here is reasonable if you want to average down on a longer-term thesis, but it's not a "pound the table" moment given lithium headwinds.

### Trade Suggestion

**Current Holders (like Jon):**
- **Hold** existing position; thesis intact but patience required
- Consider selling covered calls against shares if IV is elevated
- **Jan 2027 $10 calls** are a lottery ticket — needs lithium recovery + production start

**New Entry:**
- **Entry Zone:** $4.00 - $4.50 (on weakness)
- **Stop Loss:** $3.00 (-35% from current)
- **Target 1:** $6.50 (2027 production visibility)
- **Target 2:** $10.00 (lithium bull market scenario)
- **Position Size:** Small (2-3% of portfolio max) — speculative
- **Time Horizon:** 12-24 months
