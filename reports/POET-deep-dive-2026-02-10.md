# POET Technologies Deep Dive
**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Thesis:** Low-cap moonshot with breakthrough optical interposer technology, high dilution risk

---

## Company Overview
POET Technologies designs and manufactures integrated electronic-photonic solutions using their patented **POET Optical Interposer™** platform.

**What is the Optical Interposer?**
- Wafer-level platform that merges electronic and photonic devices into a single multi-chip module
- Eliminates traditional expensive packaging/assembly steps
- Enables smaller, cheaper, more power-efficient optical components

**Target Markets:**
- AI network interconnects
- Hyperscale data centers
- Telecommunications (5G)
- LIDAR
- Medical imaging

---

## Technology Deep Dive

### The Innovation:
Traditional approach: Separate electronic and photonic chips → expensive assembly → high power → large footprint

POET approach: Integrate both on single wafer-level platform → simplified manufacturing → lower power → smaller form factor

### Patent Position:
- Optical Interposer is **patent-protected**
- Proprietary wafer-level integration process
- High technical barrier to replication

### Products:
- **800 Gb/s optical engines** — in production
- **1.6 Tb/s receivers** — developed with Semtech collaboration
- Custom NRE (non-recurring engineering) projects

## Recent Financials ⚠️

### Q3 2025 Results
| Metric | Q3 2025 | Q2 2025 | Q3 2024 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| NRE + Product Revenue | $298K | $268K | $3.7K |
| Net Loss | ($9.4M) | - | - |
| Operating Cash Flow | ($2.8M) | ($7.7M) | - |

**Reality check:** This is essentially a pre-revenue company. Revenue is NRE projects and early product samples, not volume production.

### TTM Revenue: ~$763K (per PitchBook)

### Balance Sheet
- **Cash:** $150M+ (after 2025 raises)
- **Debt:** Minimal
- **Cash Runway:** ~2.1 years at current burn rate

## Dilution Risk 🚨🚨🚨

### 2025 Capital Raises — HIGHLY DILUTIVE:

| Date | Amount | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| April 2025 | $25M | Equity deal |
| Various 2025 | ~$250M total | Three financings |
| Jan 22, 2026 | Direct offering | Stock dropped 17% on announcement |

**This is the #1 risk for POET.** They are pre-revenue and burning cash. More dilution is likely if revenue doesn't materialize.

### Share count has expanded significantly through 2025

---

## Path to Commercialization

### Progress:
1. **Initial production orders >$5M** for 800G engines (big milestone)
2. **1.6T receivers** developed with Semtech
3. **Malaysia manufacturing** scaling up
4. **Industry recognition:** "Most Innovative" at ECOC 2025

### Timeline:
- 2025: Pilot production, NRE revenue
- **2026: Expected meaningful revenue ramp**
- 2027+: Volume production at scale (if execution successful)

---

## Market Opportunity

### Silicon Photonics TAM:
- 2025: $2.86B
- 2034: $28.75B projected
- **CAGR: 29.3%**

### Broader Photonics Market:
- 2025: $1.75T
- 2030: $2.39T projected

POET targets a subset focused on integrated photonics for data centers and AI interconnects.

## Key Risks

| Risk | Severity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **DILUTION** | EXTREME | Pre-revenue, $250M raised in 2025, more likely needed |
| Execution | HIGH | Scaling from pilot to volume is technically demanding |
| Competition | HIGH | Lumentum, Broadcom, Coherent have scale/resources |
| Cash burn | HIGH | -$2.8M/quarter operating cash flow |
| Volatility | EXTREME | Beta 2.03, 114% annualized volatility |
| Revenue timing | HIGH | Ramp could slip beyond 2026 |
| Technology adoption | MEDIUM | Customers slow to qualify new suppliers |

---

## Valuation

**Impossible to value traditionally:**
- No meaningful revenue
- No earnings
- Enterprise value offset by cash

**What you're betting on:**
- The technology works at scale
- Customers adopt it
- POET captures share before cash runs out
- No further massive dilution

**Current market cap:** Small-cap territory (~$300-500M range depending on day)

---

## Competitive Landscape

### vs Coherent (COHR):
- COHR is proven at scale, POET is not
- POET has more upside if technology wins, more downside if it doesn't
- COHR has resources to develop competing solutions

### vs AXTI:
- AXTI is substrate supplier, POET is module/integration play
- Different parts of the value chain
- Both are high-risk, different risk profiles

---

## Summary

**Bull Case:**
- Breakthrough patented technology
- Massive TAM in silicon photonics (29% CAGR)
- First production orders secured
- $150M+ cash provides runway
- 1.6T products in development with Semtech
- If it works, 10x+ potential

**Bear Case:**
- Pre-revenue — all execution ahead
- **DILUTION, DILUTION, DILUTION** — $250M raised in 2025, more coming
- Stock dropped 17% on Jan 2026 offering announcement
- Competition from well-capitalized incumbents
- Only 2.1 years cash runway at current burn
- Extreme volatility (114%)

**Bottom Line:** This is a true moonshot. The technology is real and has received validation (awards, initial orders), but POET is essentially betting the company can commercialize before running out of cash. The dilution risk is severe — they've raised $250M in 2025 alone. 

**Position sizing critical** — this could 5-10x or go to zero. Size accordingly.

## Key Dates to Watch

- **2026 revenue ramp** — will it materialize?
- Any new financing announcements (dilution)
- Production order announcements
- Customer qualification news
