## Investment Thesis

### Bull Case 🐂

1. **Mission-Critical QC** — Pharma companies *must* do microbial testing; regulatory requirement
2. **Faster = Better** — Cutting sterility testing from 14 days to <24 hours is transformational
3. **Cell & Gene Therapy Tailwind** — Short shelf-life products need rapid testing
4. **Land-and-Expand Model** — Place systems, then sell consumables
5. **High Switching Costs** — Once validated in a GMP facility, hard to replace
6. **Hiring Activity** — StockTwits noted "high level hiring" on LinkedIn (Feb 2026)

### Bear Case 🐻

1. **Small Company Risk** — Limited resources vs. larger diagnostic players
2. **Long Sales Cycles** — Pharma validation takes 12-18+ months
3. **Cash Burn** — Likely still losing money; need to check runway
4. **Competition** — Charles River, bioMérieux, and others in rapid micro space
5. **Capital Equipment Model** — Lumpy revenue, dependent on placements

## Valuation

**Current Stock Info (Feb 2026):**
- Shares Outstanding: ~44M
- Assuming stock ~$2-3/share → Market Cap: ~$90-130M

**Valuation Multiples:**
- P/S: ~3-4x (on $30M revenue)
- EV/Revenue: ~3x (adjusting for net cash)
- Book Value: Trading near tangible book ($1.00/share)

**Comps:**
- Small cap life sciences equipment companies typically trade 2-6x revenue
- Profitable diagnostic companies can trade 8-12x
- RPID discount reflects losses + cash concerns

---

## Investment Summary

### The Good ✅
1. **Revenue accelerating** — $30M TTM, ~17% growth
2. **Gross margin inflection** — Finally positive at 7.7%
3. **Differentiated product** — Automation in a manual world
4. **Cell therapy tailwind** — Short shelf-life = need for speed

### The Bad ⚠️
1. **Cash runway ~11 months** — Capital raise likely in 2026
2. **Still losing $44M/year** — Long road to profitability
3. **Small scale** — $30M revenue limits leverage
4. **Dilution risk** — 44M shares, may increase significantly

### The Verdict
**High-risk turnaround play.** The business is improving (gross margin turn, revenue growth) but the balance sheet is stressed. Key question: Can they reach profitability before running out of cash?

**Catalysts:**
- Path to breakeven guidance
- Strategic partnership or M&A interest
- Major customer wins
- Successful capital raise at non-dilutive terms

---

## Bottom Line

RPID is a **niche automation play** in a critical but unglamorous corner of pharma — quality control microbiology. The thesis is:

1. **Regulatory necessity** — Companies must test; it's not optional
2. **Speed matters** — Especially for short shelf-life products (CGT)
3. **Automation inevitable** — Manual plate counting is error-prone and labor-intensive

**Risk/Reward:** High-risk small cap with potential for strategic acquisition by larger diagnostic player. Cell & gene therapy growth could accelerate adoption.

**Catalysts to Watch:**
- Major pharma customer announcements
- Revenue acceleration / path to profitability
- M&A interest from Charles River, Danaher, Thermo Fisher
