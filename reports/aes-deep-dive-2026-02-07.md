## Bull Case

1. **AI Infrastructure Megatrend**: AES positioned at center of most significant infrastructure buildout since electrification. Data center power demand growing exponentially with AI adoption, creating multi-decade revenue opportunity.

2. **Contracted Revenue Model**: 12.3GW PPA backlog provides 15-20 year contracted cash flows with investment-grade counterparties. Removes commodity price risk and creates utility-like stability.

3. **First-Mover Advantage**: Established hyperscaler relationships and Virginia market dominance create significant barriers to entry. New entrants face 3+ year development timelines.

4. **Diversified Energy Portfolio**: Renewables, utilities, and thermal assets provide balanced cash flow streams. Thermal capacity ensures grid reliability during renewable intermittency.

5. **Policy Tailwinds**: IRA tax credits, state renewable standards, and corporate sustainability mandates accelerate clean energy adoption. AES captures maximum policy benefits.

6. **Operational Excellence**: Proven track record delivering 3.2GW annually with strong safety and schedule performance. Supply chain relationships secure equipment availability.

---

## Bear Case

1. **Capital Intensity Risk**: $1.4B+ annual capex requirements strain balance sheet and require continuous access to capital markets. Rising interest rates increase cost of capital.

2. **Grid Interconnection Challenges**: Power grid constraints and permitting delays could slow project development. Transmission bottlenecks limit renewable integration.

3. **Hyperscaler Concentration**: Over-reliance on small number of large customers creates counterparty risk. Economic downturn could reduce data center expansion.

4. **Technology Disruption**: Advances in energy efficiency or alternative power sources could reduce data center power intensity. Nuclear SMRs could provide baseload competition.

5. **Regulatory Risk**: Changes to renewable energy policies or tax credits could impact project economics. FERC reforms might alter market structures.

6. **Execution Risk**: Aggressive growth targets require flawless project execution. Construction delays or cost overruns could pressure margins.
