# APTV (Aptiv PLC) - Deep Dive Analysis
**Date:** February 6, 2026  
**Ticker:** NYSE: APTV  
**Current Price:** ~$80  
**Market Cap:** $17.5B  

---

## Executive Summary

Aptiv is a Tier-1 automotive supplier focused on advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), connected car technology, and electrical architecture. The company is undergoing a strategic transformation: spinning off its lower-margin Electrical Distribution Systems (EDS) business by March 2026 and taking a $648M impairment on Wind River. Post-separation, "RemainCo" will be a higher-margin, technology-focused business with growing non-auto exposure.

**Thesis Fit:** ⚠️ Mixed. AI integration in vehicles is real, but EV slowdown and automotive cyclicality are headwinds. International exposure is significant.

### Wind River Impairment
- $648M non-cash goodwill writedown in Q3 2025
- Original acquisition in 2022 for $5.4B
- Slower 5G adoption and software-defined vehicle delays
- Still expects mid-teens revenue growth in Wind River for 2025

## Strategic Transformation

### EDS Spin-Off (Target: March 2026)
- Separating Electrical Distribution Systems (lower-margin wiring business)
- Pro-rata dividend of new "EDS" shares to existing shareholders
- Considering sale instead of spin-off (Bloomberg, Sept 2025)

### "RemainCo" Profile (Post-Separation)
| Metric | RemainCo 2025E |
|--------|----------------|
| Revenue | $12.4B |
| EBITDA | $2.3B |
| EBITDA Margin | 19% |
| EPS | $5.50 |
| FCF | $1.0B |
| Non-Auto Mix | Growing |

**Key Point:** Post-spin Aptiv becomes a purer-play on ADAS, connected car, and high-voltage systems with structurally higher margins.

## Investment Thesis: Framework Alignment

### ⚠️ AI Integration (World Shift #1)
**Partial fit:**
- ADAS is AI at the edge - cameras, sensors, decision-making
- Software-defined vehicles require Aptiv's connectivity solutions
- Wind River software platforms enable OTA updates, AI workloads

**But:** Adoption slower than expected. Wind River impairment signals market disappointment. Full autonomy (Motional JV) continues to lose money.

### ⚠️ Robotics/Drones Mainstream (World Shift #4)
**Indirect exposure:**
- Motional autonomous JV with Hyundai (equity losses ~$0.20/share in 2025)
- Not a direct robotics play
- Autonomous driving commercialization remains elusive

### ✅ International Exposure
Strong geographic diversification:
- North America: 40%+ of revenue, growing fastest
- Europe: Large presence but declining
- Asia: Significant, includes China exposure
- Growing in India (recent Gen 6 ADAS contract)

**Non-US outperformance:** Mixed. Best growth is actually in North America. Europe is weak. China is flat.

## Near-Term Catalysts

1. **EDS Spin-Off Completion (Q1 2026):** Unlocks sum-of-parts value
2. **India ADAS Contract Ramp:** New Gen 6 platform win
3. **Non-Auto Growth:** Double-digit in industrial/aerospace
4. **Share Buybacks:** $2.4B remaining authorization
5. **EV Recovery:** If EV demand re-accelerates, APTV benefits

---

## Risks & Bear Case

1. **Automotive Cyclicality:** OEM production cuts hit suppliers first
2. **China Competition:** Local players undercutting on price
3. **EV Slowdown:** High-voltage systems demand slowing
4. **Wind River Integration:** Already impaired, execution risk remains
5. **Motional Losses:** Continuing drag on earnings (~$0.20/share)
6. **Trade Tensions:** Tariff risk flagged in guidance
7. **Debt Level:** 79.5% D/E is concerning for a cyclical

---

## Valuation Context

**Sum-of-Parts View:**
- RemainCo (ASUX segment + Wind River): ~$12.4B revenue at 19% EBITDA = $2.3B EBITDA
- At 8x EV/EBITDA = $18.4B enterprise value
- EDS segment could fetch $4-6B in sale
- Combined: $22-24B potential value vs. $17.5B market cap

**Comps:**
| Company | P/E | EV/EBITDA |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| APTV | ~10x adj | ~6x |
| BWA (BorgWarner) | 8x | 4x |
| MMBTY (Magna) | 7x | 3x |
| AXL (American Axle) | 4x | 3x |

APTV trades at a premium to traditional auto suppliers on growth profile.

## Conclusion

**Rating: SPECULATIVE BUY**

APTV is a show-me story. The EDS spin-off could unlock significant value, and post-separation RemainCo will be a higher-quality business. However, Wind River impairment, Motional losses, and automotive cyclicality create uncertainty.

**Bull case:** EDS spin creates $22B+ combined value, ADAS adoption accelerates, RemainCo trades at 12x EBITDA → $100+ stock.

**Bear case:** Auto production cuts, EV slowdown persists, EDS sale falls through → $50-60 stock.

**Best Entry:** Wait for EDS clarity. If spin completes cleanly by Q1 2026, RemainCo could be an attractive mid-cap tech-auto play.

**Position sizing:** Smaller position given cyclical risk and transformation uncertainty.
