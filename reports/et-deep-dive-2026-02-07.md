## Key Issues/Catalyst

### Data Center & AI Power Demand Explosion

**Oracle Partnership Highlights:**
- **Contract Scope:** 900 MMcf/d of natural gas supply to 3 data centers
- **Geographic Focus:** 2 Texas facilities plus additional U.S. locations
- **Duration:** Long-term agreements providing cash flow visibility
- **Infrastructure:** New pipeline lateral already under construction

**Broader Data Center Strategy:**
- **Entergy Louisiana:** 250,000 MMBtu/d firm transportation (20-year term)
- **Power Generation Growth:** Data centers driving natural gas demand
- **Geographic Advantage:** Texas infrastructure serves major data center hub
- **Reliability Premium:** 24/7 power requirements favor gas over renewables

### Permian Basin Production Growth
- **Gathered Volumes:** Up 3% to record levels in Q3 2025
- **New Processing Plants:** Mustang Draw II (250 MMcf/d) by Q4 2026
- **NGL Transportation:** Up 11% to record 2.48M bbls/d
- **Takeaway Capacity:** Addressing production bottlenecks

### Strategic Growth Projects 2026
- **Natural Gas Storage:** Bethel facility expansion (12 Bcf capacity)
- **Price River Terminal:** Double APU oil export capacity
- **Transwestern Expansion:** Desert Southwest capacity upsizing
- **Processing Expansion:** Multiple Permian processing facilities

## Bull Case

1. **AI/Data Center Infrastructure Play**: ET positioned as primary beneficiary of explosive data center power demand growth. Natural gas provides 24/7 baseload power that renewables cannot match, driving long-term contracted demand.

2. **Irreplaceable Infrastructure Moat**: 140,000-mile pipeline network creates insurmountable barriers to entry. Existing assets connect all major basins to demand centers, making ET an essential service provider.

3. **Permian Production Tailwinds**: Continued Permian Basin growth drives volumes across entire value chain. ET's dominant position in gathering, processing, and transportation captures maximum value.

4. **LNG Export Growth**: Future Lake Charles LNG project (under evaluation) plus existing pipeline connections to Gulf Coast provide exposure to global LNG demand growth.

5. **Fee-Based Business Model**: Majority of cash flows from transportation and processing fees with limited commodity exposure. Contracted revenues provide stability and predictability.

6. **Distribution Growth Track Record**: Consistent distribution increases demonstrate management's commitment to unitholder returns. Strong coverage provides sustainability and growth potential.

---

## Bear Case

1. **High Leverage Risk**: $63B debt burden creates refinancing risk in rising rate environment. Interest coverage adequate but declining with higher rates.

2. **Commodity Exposure**: Despite fee-based focus, significant exposure to NGL and oil price volatility through marketing and optimization activities.

3. **Capital Intensity**: $5+ billion annual capex requirements strain cash flow and require continuous debt or equity financing. Rising costs pressure project returns.

4. **Regulatory & Environmental Risk**: Pipeline projects face increasing permitting challenges and environmental opposition. FERC policies could impact interstate rates.

5. **Energy Transition Risk**: Long-term shift to renewables could reduce natural gas demand over 10+ year horizon. Stranded asset risk for long-lived infrastructure.

6. **Concentration Risk**: Heavy exposure to Texas and Permian Basin creates geographic concentration risk. Production declines or regulatory changes impact multiple business lines.
