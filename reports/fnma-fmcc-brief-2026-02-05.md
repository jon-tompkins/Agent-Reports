# Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac: The 17-Year Bet

*Last updated: February 5, 2026*

**⚠️ DISCLAIMER: This is NOT investment advice. FNMA/FMCC are highly speculative. Do your own research.**

## WTF Is Going On?

Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) have been in government conservatorship since **September 2008**. That's 17+ years. These two companies back roughly **$7 trillion** in mortgages—nearly half of all US home loans.

The stocks trade on OTC markets (not NYSE/NASDAQ) at a fraction of their book value. Common shares have been in limbo, waiting for an "exit" that keeps getting promised but never delivered.

## The Bull Case 🐂

**"This time it's different"** — yeah, I know. But here's why some believe it:

1. **Political tailwinds**: The current administration has signaled interest in housing finance reform. Treasury has more flexibility now than in previous years.

2. **Massive book value**: Combined book value is ~$140B+. Common shares trade at ~$3-6. If they exit conservatorship with shareholder value intact, the upside is potentially 5-20x.

3. **Profitable machines**: Post-2012, both companies have been wildly profitable. They've sent ~$300B to Treasury. The "bailout" has been repaid many times over.

4. **Legal precedent**: Courts have ruled the Net Worth Sweep (where Treasury took 100% of profits) was legal, but political pressure could still force a resolution.

5. **Capital building**: They've been retaining earnings since 2019. Getting closer to required capital levels every quarter.

## The Bear Case 🐻

**"This has been 'about to happen' for 17 years":**

1. **Political football**: Housing finance reform requires Congress OR creative Treasury action. Both are hard. Neither party wants to "own" any changes that could affect housing prices.

2. **The Senior Preferred Problem**: Treasury holds $190B+ in senior preferred stock with liquidation preference. Common shareholders are junior to this. Any exit plan needs to address this—likely through conversion, cancellation, or massive dilution.

3. **Dilution risk**: The most likely exit scenarios involve issuing billions in new shares. Your $5 share could easily become $1 post-offering.

4. **OTC hellscape**: These trade on pink sheets. Liquidity sucks. Spreads are wide. Getting in is easy; getting out at your price isn't.

5. **Legal uncertainty**: Shareholders have sued. They've mostly lost. Courts have upheld the government's broad powers during conservatorship.

## Timeline Reality Check ⏰

**Be honest with yourself:**

| Scenario | Probability | Timeline |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Full exit with common equity value | Low | 5-10+ years |
| Partial restructuring | Medium | 3-7 years |
| Indefinite conservatorship | Medium-High | Forever |
| Common shares wiped out | Low-Medium | Anytime |

Every administration since 2008 has kicked this can. Obama, Trump (first term), Biden—all talked reform, none delivered. Trump's second term *might* be different given stated priorities, but don't hold your breath.

**Key dates that matter:**
- Treasury leadership changes
- FHFA director decisions  
- Any Congressional housing finance bills (rare)
- Capital milestone announcements

## Major Risks ⚠️

1. **Total loss possible**: Common shares could go to zero. This isn't FUD—it's a real scenario if exit involves wiping equity.

2. **Political 180**: One tweet, one policy shift, one new Treasury Secretary could tank the thesis.

3. **Decades more waiting**: There's no legal requirement to ever exit conservatorship. They could stay in zombie mode indefinitely.

4. **Dilution to oblivion**: Even a "successful" exit could mean your shares get diluted 90%+.

5. **Liquidity trap**: When news hits, spreads blow out. You might not exit at your target price.

## The Verdict 🎯

**This is speculation, not investment.**

FNMA/FMCC are lottery tickets with better-than-lottery odds but nowhere close to "investing" in any traditional sense.

**If you're considering it:**

✅ **DO:**
- Limit to **1-3% of portfolio max**
- Use money you can 100% lose
- Set it and forget it (5-10 year horizon minimum)
- Understand you're betting on political outcomes
- Buy both (don't pick one)

❌ **DON'T:**
- YOLO your savings
- Expect quick returns
- Trade on every news headline
- Use margin
- Bet rent money

**Position sizing matters more than entry price.** Whether you buy at $3 or $6, the binary outcome (moon or zero) dominates any entry optimization.

## TL;DR

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Upside | Potentially 5-20x if exit preserves equity |
| Downside | 100% loss is on the table |
| Timeline | 5-10+ years, politically dependent |
| Probability of win | Low to medium |
| Recommended allocation | 1-3% max (speculation money only) |

**Bottom line:** If you have conviction, take a small position and forget about it for years. If you're looking for "safe" investments, look elsewhere. This is a political bet wrapped in a stock ticker.

*The housing market runs on Fannie and Freddie. Whether shareholders ever benefit from that is an entirely different question.*
