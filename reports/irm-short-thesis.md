- **BUT**: Net income only $106M quarterly ($184M full year)
- **Red Flag**: Growth driven by price increases (30-400% in core services) not volume

### Volume Decline Concerns:
- North American physical storage volumes slightly negative
- American and Europe volumes declining (per Gotham City Research)
- Growth coming from less profitable international markets (30-54% less profitable)

- Cash flow hasn't covered dividends for 12 years
- SEC questioning adjusted EBITDA calculations
- 40 executives left since COO retirement in March 2024

## 3. Upcoming Catalysts

### Earnings Dates:

### Potential Negative Catalysts:
- Volume decline acceleration in physical storage
- SEC inquiry into accounting practices intensifying
- Data center competition pressure margins
- Dividend sustainability questions (payout ratio >200% by some estimates)
- Customer pushback on aggressive price increases

## 4. Bull Case Counter-Arguments

### Data Center Growth:
- Strong data center business growing (130 MW expected in 2024)
- Converting some physical storage facilities to data centers
- Riding AI/datacenter trend despite overall thesis

### Defensive Characteristics:
- REIT structure with dividend requirement

- Essential for compliance/regulatory requirements

### Analyst Defense:

**Risk Management**:
- Stop loss at $100 (new highs)
