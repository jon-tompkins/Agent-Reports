**Ticker:** NYSE: OXY  
**Current Price:** ~$45  
**Market Cap:** $46B

## Executive Summary

Occidental is a major integrated oil & gas producer with leading Permian Basin assets and a differentiated carbon capture strategy (1PointFive/STRATOS). Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns 27% and recently acquired OxyChem for $9.7B, signaling long-term confidence. Debt reduction is the key focus after the 2019 Anadarko acquisition. The carbon capture optionality is undervalued.

**Thesis Fit:** ✅ Strong alignment with Energy Demand theme. Buffett sponsorship provides downside protection.

## The Buffett Factor

**Berkshire Hathaway Position:**

- Recently acquired OxyChem for $9.7B

**Why Buffett Likes OXY:**
1. Dominant Permian position with long reserve life
2. CEO Vicki Hollub - Buffett has praised her operational excellence
3. Carbon capture optionality (1PointFive)
4. Consistent debt paydown demonstrates capital discipline
5. Low-cost producer in premier US oil basin

**Buffett's implicit floor:** With 27% ownership and $9.7B OxyChem deal, Berkshire is effectively all-in on OXY's success.

## Investment Thesis: Framework Alignment

### ✅ Energy Demand (World Shift #6)
OXY is a direct beneficiary of AI-driven energy demand:
- Permian Basin is the world's most prolific oil-producing region
- Natural gas from Permian feeds power generation (including peaker plants)
- IEA: Data center electricity demand to double by 2030
- Oil & gas peaker plants staying online longer due to AI power needs

**Key insight:** Every AI data center needs reliable power. Until grid and renewables scale, that means fossil fuels. OXY's low-cost Permian production is ideally positioned.

### ✅ Carbon Capture Leadership (Unique)
OXY has the most advanced carbon capture program among majors:

**1PointFive & STRATOS:**
- World's largest Direct Air Capture (DAC) facility
- $1.3B investment in Ector County, Texas
- EPA Class VI permits secured (April 2025)
- Commercially operational mid-2025
- Sells carbon removal credits to corporates seeking net-zero

**Why This Matters:**
- Creates optionality for carbon credit monetization
- Positions OXY for energy transition without abandoning core business
- Could become material earnings contributor by 2027-2030
- Big Tech (Microsoft, etc.) are major DAC credit buyers

---

## Near-Term Catalysts

1. **OxyChem Sale Closing:** $9.7B cash to accelerate deleveraging
2. **Q4 2025 Earnings (Feb 18, 2026):** Potential beat given strong execution
3. **STRATOS Commercial Operations:** Proof of DAC economics at scale
4. **Berkshire Accumulation:** Any further buying signals confidence
5. **Debt Below $15B:** Would trigger multiple re-rating

---

## Risks & Bear Case

1. **Oil Price Sensitivity:** ~$5/bbl change = ~$500M annual EBITDA impact
2. **Debt Still High:** $20.8B principal, though improving rapidly
3. **Carbon Capture Execution:** STRATOS unproven at commercial scale
4. **Valuation Premium:** 30x P/E is rich for an oil major
5. **Permian Decline Rates:** Basin-wide production growth slowing

---

## Valuation Context

**Sum-of-Parts:**
- Permian assets alone worth $30-40B based on transactions
- OxyChem sale at $9.7B validates chemical segment value
- Carbon capture (1PointFive) = free optionality currently
- At $45/share, you're getting core O&G + carbon capture upside

**Comps:**
| Company | P/E | EV/EBITDA |
|---------|-----|-----------|
| OXY | 30.4x | ~5x |
| XOM | 14x | ~6x |
| CVX | 16x | ~5x |

OXY trades at a premium on Buffett halo and carbon optionality.

## Conclusion

**Rating: HOLD**

OXY is a high-quality energy name with unique carbon capture optionality and the ultimate seal of approval from Warren Buffett. However, current valuation reflects much of the good news. The 30x P/E is stretched for an oil major, and the stock has underperformed the market (-4% 1Y).

**Bull case:** Oil stays $70+, debt below $15B, STRATOS proves DAC economics, Buffett keeps buying → $60+ stock.

**Bear case:** Oil drops to $50, carbon capture delays, Buffett trims → $35 stock.

**Best Entry:** On oil price weakness (<$40) or broad market pullback. Buffett provides a floor.

**Position sizing:** Core holding for energy exposure given quality, but current price demands patience.
