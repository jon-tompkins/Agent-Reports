# CVNA (Carvana) - Deep Dive Analysis
## Focus: Underwater Loan Thesis & Related Party Concerns
**Date:** February 6, 2026  
**Ticker:** NYSE: CVNA  
**Current Price:** ~$384  
**Market Cap:** ~$86B

## Executive Summary

Carvana is a high-flying used car e-commerce platform that has rebounded spectacularly from near-bankruptcy in 2022-2023 (+3,100% over 3 years). However, the company faces serious questions about its loan portfolio quality, with **44% of cars financed since 2022 being underwater** (loan > car value). Hindenburg Research published a scathing report alleging accounting manipulation, related-party transactions, and a looming credit crisis. The valuation at 86x earnings leaves no margin for error.

**Thesis Fit:** ⚠️ This is a **potential SHORT candidate** if the underwater loan thesis proves out. Does not fit the "good company in growing industry" framework.

## The Underwater Loan Problem

### The Core Issue
Per CarEdge (December 2024): **~44% of cars financed since 2022 are in negative equity** (underwater). This means:
- Borrower owes more than car is worth
- Can't refinance or trade-in easily
- Higher default risk if financial stress hits
- Carvana often rolls negative equity into new loans, compounding the problem

### Used Car Price Collapse
| Metric | Change |
|--------|--------|
| Manheim Used Vehicle Index | -20.3% over 3 years |
| Peak (Jan 2022) | 258 |
| Current | ~205 |

When used car prices fall, loan-to-value ratios worsen automatically. A car bought at peak 2022 prices with 10% down is now deeply underwater.

### Subprime Stress
Per Fitch: **Subprime auto loan delinquencies are now HIGHER than during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.**

Carvana's exposure:
- 44% of loans sold in ABS deals are non-prime
- 80%+ of non-prime deals are "deep subprime" (FICO <550)
- 60-day delinquencies on "prime" loans are **4x industry averages**
- Extensions doubled in 2024 (masking delinquencies)

## Hindenburg Research Allegations (January 2025)

Hindenburg published a devastating short report alleging:

### 1. Related Party Shenanigans
- **DriveTime Connection:** Carvana's CEO's father (Ernest Garcia II, convicted felon) owns DriveTime
- $145M in "other revenue" from related parties in 2023
- Cars dumped to DriveTime at premium prices to avoid markdowns
- Warranty costs shifted to DriveTime to inflate Carvana revenue
- *"It's kind of like Fight Club... we don't talk about DriveTime"* — Former Carvana director

### 2. Mystery Loan Buyer
- Ally Financial pulled back (from 60% to 35% of loan purchases)
- New "unrelated third party" emerged buying $800M in loans
- Lien filings suggest buyer is **Cerberus Capital**, where Carvana Director Dan Quayle is Chairman
- Would be **undisclosed related party** if true

### 3. Lax Underwriting
- *"We actually approved 100% of the applicants"* — Former Carvana director
- Loans made with negative equity rolled in
- *"I don't think the model is much different than... early 2000 mortgage-backed securities"* — Former director

### 4. Accounting Games
- No loss reserves on $553M of loans held on books
- Loan sale timing manipulated around quarters
- Retail gross profit per unit inflated ~34.5% by cost misclassification
- "Economy line" reconditioning with lower standards (undisclosed)

### 5. Insider Selling
- Ernest Garcia II (CEO's father) sold **$3.6B** in stock (2020-2021)
- Stock then crashed 99%
- Since 2023 recovery, sold another **$1.4B**
- Pattern: Hype stock, dump shares, repeat

### 6. Conflicted Board
- "Independent" audit committee members served on DriveTime board
- One member previously suspended by NYSE for violating prohibition order

### 7. Undisclosed SEC Investigation
Per FOIA research, SEC investigation underway (not disclosed to investors)

## Financial Overview

### Current Financials
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue (TTM) | $18.27B |
| Earnings (TTM) | $629M |
| EPS | $4.45 |
| P/E | 86x |
| P/S | 3.0x |
| Debt/Equity | 155% |
| Net Debt | ~$4.8B |

### The Valuation Problem
| Company | P/E | P/S |
|---------|-----|-----|
| CVNA | 86x | 3.0x |
| CarMax (KMX) | ~11x | 0.3x |
| AutoNation (AN) | ~8x | 0.2x |

CVNA trades at:
- **845% premium** to peers on P/S
- **754% premium** on forward P/E

### Business Model Dependency
~26% of Carvana's gross profit comes from **gain on loan sales**. This is 2.2x their net income.

If loan buyers pull back (as Ally has), this profit evaporates.

## The Bear Case in Detail

### 1. Credit Cycle Turning
- Subprime delinquencies at record highs
- Used car prices still falling
- Consumer balance sheets stretched
- Fed rates elevated

### 2. Ally Relationship at Risk
- Purchase commitment expired January 2025
- Ally stock fell 20% on credit warnings (Sept 2024)
- "We've pulled back from them pretty significantly" — Ally executive
- If renegotiated on worse terms, margin compression

### 3. ABS Market Stress
- Investors increasingly wary of subprime auto
- Higher spreads = lower gain on sale
- Potential for securitization market to freeze

### 4. Related Party Unwind
- If Cerberus stops buying, who fills the gap?
- DriveTime support could be pulled back
- Any related party disclosure issues = SEC risk

### 5. Valuation Compression
- At 86x earnings, expectations are sky-high
- Any miss = violent selloff (Beta = 3.57)
- Junk-rated debt limits financial flexibility

---

## The Bull Case (For Balance)

1. **Operational Improvements:** Costs have been cut, margins improved
2. **Market Share Gains:** Taking share from legacy dealers
3. **ADESA Acquisition:** Diversified revenue via wholesale auctions
4. **Used Car Shortage:** Long-term tailwind from new car production gaps
5. **Digital Advantage:** Better customer experience than dealerships

---

## Conclusion

**Rating: AVOID / POTENTIAL SHORT**

The underwater loan thesis is well-supported by data:
- 44% of financed cars underwater
- Subprime delinquencies at GFC levels
- Lax underwriting by admission
- Suspicious related party transactions
- Massive insider selling

The stock has recovered based on modest positive earnings, but 86x P/E prices in perfection. Any deterioration in:
- Loan sale pricing
- Ally relationship
- Consumer credit
- Used car prices

...would trigger significant downside.

**If you own CVNA:** Consider reducing or hedging. The risk/reward is asymmetric to the downside.

**If considering short:** Timing is difficult (stock has been a widow-maker for shorts). Wait for:
- Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 18) disappointment
- Ally relationship disclosure
- SEC investigation news
- Credit deterioration acceleration

**Position sizing:** If short, size small. CVNA can squeeze violently.

## Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Gain on Loan Sale Margin:** Any compression signals trouble
2. **Loan Sale Mix:** Who is buying? What terms?
3. **60-Day Delinquencies:** Leading indicator of losses
4. **Extensions Granted:** If climbing, masking defaults
5. **Used Car Prices:** Manheim Index trajectory
6. **Ally Disclosures:** Any pullback or re-negotiation
